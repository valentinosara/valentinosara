# üí´ About Me:
Since I started studying programming, I‚Äôve immersed myself in languages like Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, while also gaining hands-on experience with frameworks like Node.js and .NET. I developed a web application using C# and .NET MVC, a sushi page with a shopping cart system that‚Äôs helped me apply my technical knowledge in real-world scenarios.<br><br>What motivates me in the world of development is the challenge of solving problems through code. I thrive on designing algorithms and creating software solutions that address common challenges efficiently. Each project, whether academic or self-initiated, has allowed me to refine my skills, adapt to new tools, and constantly improve my approach to coding.<br><br>I describe myself as disciplined, focused, and dedicated. I‚Äôm someone who strives for excellence in every task I undertake. I'm also self-taught, constantly learning and expanding my skill set to stay up to date with the latest technologies. My current knowledge spans Java, JavaScript, C#, .NET, SQL, and web development frameworks, and I‚Äôm eager to contribute these skills in a professional setting.<br><br>I‚Äôm actively seeking opportunities to grow as a back end or full stack developer, where I can apply my passion for programming and problem-solving. Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre interested in discussing potential collaborations or opportunities in tech!
